2.)
-showAUC --- 
show the Area Under the ROC curve (for each class)
This is an evaluation option which tells the system to output the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) as part of the
evaluation metrics. There will be one AUC for each possible value of the class attribute, which reflects how well the
prediction-scores for that class-value are separated from all other classes.

-depth d --- 
when training, make neighbor class labels visible up to depth d
This option is primarily for testing purposes. When estimating the performance of a model, some known labels v test
are hidden while learning the model M . Model M is then applied to estimate the labels in v test .
This option is used to make labels of neighbors up to the given depth visible while training model M . With this, it is
possible to get an estimate of how well you could do, where you to be given this information. This can also be thought
of as sampling subgraphs of the given depth.

-pruneSingletons --- 
remove singleton nodes in the graph
Use this option to prune out nodes in the data that are not connected to any other nodes. This is the setting that is often
used for evaluating the relational learners, as these singleton nodes obviously have no relations and therefore do not give
any insight into how well the relational learners are performing.

-pruneZeroKnowledge --- 
remove zeroKnowledge nodes in the graph
This is a stronger pruning than the -pruneSingletons (see ยง4.2.14) option. Given a set of nodes whose labels
are known (the training examples), this setting will remove any node in the graph that are not connected (directly or
indirectly) to a node in the training set.
